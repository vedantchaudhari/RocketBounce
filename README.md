# RocketBounce
SDEV-450 Final Project

---SETUP---
JavaFX was removed from JDK 11, which just so happens to be the JDK we used for this project :') fun times. We have a small amount of JAR files that need to be added as external libraries before this project is able to run. Here are the steps:
1) Locate the "External Libraries" folder within RocketBounce directory

2) Give the path for the JAR files to your local copy of the project
  2a. For Intellij, go to File > Projet Structure > Global Libraries and "+" add all the .jars located in the External Libraries folder
  2b. For NetBeans, right click the open project and click Properties. Project Properties will pop up. Navigate to Libraries > Add JAR/Folder and add all .jar files located in External Libraries folder
  
3) Build/Rebuild
